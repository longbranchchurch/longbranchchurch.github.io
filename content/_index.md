## Always Free.</br>Always Outside.</br>Open to All Men.

F3 Carpex is a free outdoor men’s only workout group.
We meet at parks across Cary and Apex North Carolina Monday through Saturday. Rain or shine.
But it’s more than just a workout… Learn more below!

The workouts are for men of all fitness levels and goals, and include running; cardio with total-body and body-weight exercises; limited run and strength-building with dumbells, kettleballs, and other toys; walking; rucking; recovery stretching and yoga!

## Lead right

There's an expression in F3 that you are "freed to lead." Whether it's plugging into an existing effort or starting a new training program or service opportunity, you are welcome not only to join, but to lead.

In person at an AO or virtually on Slack are the best places to connect with the Pax as you plan out a new leadership opportunity.

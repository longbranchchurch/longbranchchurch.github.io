## Why Do We Give?
</br>
Giving is a form of worshiping. The biblical principle for giving is that we put God first, not last or whatever is left over. Everything the Lord gives to us, He gives it so that it might be conveyed or delivered through us. The Bible speaks of sowing and reaping. It is a principle that works in agriculture, and it is a principle that works in the Christian life. 
</br>
When it comes to sowing and reaping, there must be a level of trust. When the farmer buys seed and plants it in the ground, he trusts that he will reap a harvest from the seed that he sows. If the farmer holds onto the seed and never sows it in the ground, he will not reap a harvest. He will only have what is in his hand.
</br>

# Psalm 24:1
</br>
The earth is the Lordâ€™s, and all it contains,
</br>
The world, and those who dwell in it.
</br>

## Little Kids and Kids Church
During our 10AM worship service, we offer a few options for our kids. Along with a nursery for kids 2 and under, we offer a Little Kids Church service for Pre-K kids.</br>
</br>
We also offer Kids Church for kids, Kindergarten to 5th Grade. Kids Church meets in the Fellowship Hall.</br>
</br>
Our goal in Little Kids and Kids Church is to help kids grow by connecting their hearts with Jesus' heart and showing them how to live like Him, using Bible stories to teach and apply these lessons. We believe that knowing the application of the stories is just as, if not more, important than knowing the story itself.

## Wednesday Night Classes
Our Wednesday Night classes meet every Wednesday, 6:45PM-7:30PM. These classes meet in grade/age-specific groups. These groups are: Pre-K, K-2nd Grade, 3rd-5th Grade, and Middle/High School youth.<br>
<br>
Our goal for Wednesday night classes is to working together in service to others to develop a deeper understanding of His character and Word. We believe that the more children are exposed to the needs of others and realize how much they can do to relieve those needs, the more they will want to serve.<br>
<br>
> **Philippians 2:4** Let each of you look not only to his own interests, but also to the interests of others.<br>
